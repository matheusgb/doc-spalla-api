# Token Authentication

To leverage all the features of our amazing API, you need to add the Bearer Token to the 
header of your HTTP requests. ðŸš€

But how can you obtain this authentication token? It's simple! Visit the 
[website](https://console.spalla.io/api-keys), log in, and generate a new API key 
exclusively for you.

Now, armed with the Bearer Token, you can make requests. Here's an example using JavaScript:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers filename="JavaScript"
const url = 'https://api.spalla.io/example';
const token = 'your_token_here';

fetch(url, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
  .then(response => {
    // Process the API response here
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle request errors
  });

```
Remember to replace `https://api.spalla.io/example` with the correct URL of our API and 
`your_token_here` with your actual Bearer Token.

Now you're ready to explore all the incredible features of our API and create powerful 
integrations in your projects! ðŸ˜Š
